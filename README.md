The use of a doubly-linked list to create a database for a list of rugby players

An object orientated program for a Rugby club using a doubly linked list of nodes. Each node describes a rugby player. Each rugby player is described by a name, a registration number, a team, an age and a position attribute. The List class is created for the doubly linked list. The List class will allow the user to traverse a list of nodes (players) and search for specific players by their playing position.
